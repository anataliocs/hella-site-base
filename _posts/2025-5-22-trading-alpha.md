### Thank you!  

The development of games is a monumental effort that requires a harmonious blend of disciplines. Artists craft stunning visuals, animators breathe life into characters, and sound designers create immersive audio landscapes. Meanwhile, programmers build the mechanics and physics that underpin the game world, ensuring every leap, collision, and dialogue flows seamlessly. This intricate dance of creativity and engineering is what makes gaming an unparalleled experience.

{: .note }
A major advantage of indie games is their focus on storytelling.

> Games provide the perfect balance of fun and relaxation, letting you unwind and recharge.

{: .tip }
Indie games are often created by small teams or even solo developers, allowing for a level of creative freedom thatâ€™s rarely seen in big-budget games.

```js
  $('.top').click(function () {
    $('html, body').stop().animate({ scrollTop: 0 }, 'slow', 'swing');
  });
  $(window).scroll(function () {
    if ($(this).scrollTop() > $(window).height()) {
      $('.top').addClass("top-active");
    } else {
      $('.top').removeClass("top-active");
    };
  });
```
